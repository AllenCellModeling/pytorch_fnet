    "## DNA channel prediction from transmitted light channel\n",
    "The goal is to create a model capable of taking in (3D) transmitted light images of cells and predicting what the DNA channel would be. The original CZI images are too large to fit in memory, so we train the model by looking at smaller, random \"chunks\" of the original image. We also downsize the original image so each chunk can contain ~1-2 cells."
